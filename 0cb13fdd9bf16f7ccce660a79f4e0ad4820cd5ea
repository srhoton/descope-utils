## Original User Request
> In this repo we want to build a set of tools for working with descope. Specifically, we want to use their Java SDK to:
> - Create a descope application
> - Create a descope tenant and add it to the application
> - Create a user in the tenant
>
> This should end up being a set of command line tools that can be used to manage descope resources programmatically.

# Prompt History for Commit: Service Layer

## Original User Request
> In this repo we want to build a set of tools for working with descope. Specifically, we want to use their Java SDK to:
> - Create a descope application
> - Create a descope tenant and add it to the application
> - Create a user in the tenant
>
> This should end up being a set of command line tools that can be used to manage descope resources programmatically.

## Plan Reference
- Component: Descope Service Layer
- From Plan: /Users/steverhoton/git/descope-utils/sdlc-plan.md
- Description: Service layer that wraps Descope SDK operations with idempotency checks, error handling, and business logic

## Implementation Approach
Stub implementations were created to enable CLI development to proceed while deferring full SDK integration to the integration testing phase. This approach allows:
- CLI commands to be developed and tested against stub responses
- Full SDK integration to happen with real API calls in Component 8
- Iterative development without blocking on external API dependencies

## Services Implemented
1. **DescopeService**: Base service providing DescopeClient creation and error wrapping
2. **ApplicationService**: Stub for creating Descope applications
3. **TenantService**: Stub for creating tenants and associating with apps
4. **UserService**: Stub for creating users in tenants

## Testing
- All services have comprehensive unit tests
- Tests verify stub behavior without requiring real SDK integration
- Fixed QuarkusTest issues by removing annotations where CDI not needed
- All tests passing with proper coverage

## Functional Review
- Status: Approved
- Services provide required method signatures for CLI integration
- Proper structure in place for future SDK integration
- Error handling and logging framework established

## Code Quality Review
- Status: Approved
- Clean CDI bean setup with @ApplicationScoped
- Proper JavaDoc documentation
- Services clearly documented as stubs
- Spotless formatting applied
- All tests passing

## Next Steps
Component 6 (CLI Commands) can now be implemented using these service stubs.
Full SDK integration will occur in Component 8 (Integration Tests).

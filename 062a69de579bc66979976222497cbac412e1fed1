# Prompt History for Commit: CLI Commands

## Original User Request
> In this repo we want to build a set of tools for working with descope...
> This should end up being a set of command line tools that can be used to manage descope resources programmatically.

## Plan Reference
- Component: CLI Commands
- From Plan: /Users/steverhoton/git/descope-utils/sdlc-plan.md
- Description: Command-line interface with subcommands for create-app, create-tenant, create-user operations

## Implementation Details
Implemented complete Picocli-based CLI with:
1. DescopeUtilsCommand: Main command that delegates to subcommands
2. GlobalOptions: Shared options for all commands (--project-id, --management-key, --output)
3. CreateAppCommand: Creates Descope applications with optional description
4. CreateTenantCommand: Creates tenants with optional app association
5. CreateUserCommand: Creates users in tenants

## Technical Approach
- Used Quarkus Picocli integration for CDI support
- Commands inject ConfigurationService, service layer beans, and OutputFormatter
- Proper error handling with System.exit codes
- Support for both JSON and TEXT output formats via OutputFormat enum

## Testing
- Unit tests for GlobalOptions parsing
- Unit tests for each command argument parsing
- Tests use parseArgs() instead of execute() to avoid System.exit() during testing
- All tests passing

## Functional Review
- Status: Approved
- All required commands implemented
- Proper integration with service layer and configuration
- Error handling with appropriate exit codes

## Code Quality Review
- Status: Approved
- Clean separation of concerns
- Comprehensive JavaDoc
- Spotless formatting applied
- All tests passing

## Next Steps
Component 7 (Main Application Entry Point) will bootstrap Quarkus and execute these commands.
